## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

MHSoftUI is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MHSoftUI'
```


## Requirements

1. Swift 5 or later
2. Xcode 11 or later
3. iOS 12 or later
4. UIKit framework (not SwiftUI)
5. It is prefered to choose a very light color for your controller's background and the same color to your UI components, for example:
`self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor(red: 241/255, green: 243/255, blue: 246/255, alpha: 1.0)`

## Usage

`import MHSoftUI` where needed.

#### For UIView: ####
Simply call this method with your view object for standard SoftUI Effect:

`myView.addSoftUIEffectForView()`

#### For UIButton: ####

`let myButton = MHSoftUIButton()`
`myButton.addSoftUIEffectForButton()`

## Important
1. Must call these functions inside `viewDidAppear`, not `viewDidLoad`.
2. For button to animate, it is important to give it MHSoftUIButton class reference, which is a subclass of UIButton.

## Cutomization ##

There are parameters to each method that will let you customize the effect of SoftUI:

`someButton.addSoftUIEffectForButton(cornerRadius: someButton.bounds.height/2, themeColor: UIColor(red: 241/255, green: 243/255, blue: 246/255, alpha: 1.0))`
